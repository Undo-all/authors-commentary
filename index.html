    This part is the author commentary. Okay, admittedly, this entire this is the author commentary. But hear me out: maybe an entire story can just be author commentary. Maybe metatextually talking about the writing process *itself* is a viable way to tell a story. So, that's how this one will be told. Whatever it is, I haven't decided yet.</p>
Now that we've got that set up, let's move on to writing the story. Stories generally have characters, don't they? Even if you somehow tried to write a story with no characters, people with ascribe independent agents to the events that take place and eventually those independent agents would be interpreted as characters, even though they were never meant to be in the first place. It's like how we draw comparisions to emotions in order to describe events that happen due to physical laws alone. Positive charges "don't like each other" and stuff like that. But I'm getting away from the point here: this is a story and stories have characters. Usually a protagonist who we can relate to, and we may even experience events from the perspective of (of course, this will not be the case here, since we will be experiencing events from the author's perspective).
<p>
Let's get some details on our hero/main dude/morally ambiguous figure/author insert/reader insert, or whatever they'll be. We'll figure out their character before we figure out their circumstances and the state of the larger world in general. So here's a very baseline question:
</p>
<h1><strike>Is our character male or female?</strike></h1>
<p>
Actually, that isn't baseline enough. Although gender feels like it's the lowest common denominator in terms of character details, there are some unaddressed assumptions in that question. Let's get really basic, like 20 questions basic. 
</p><p>
<h1>Is our character a living thing?</h1>
That's an interesting question! A story about a somehow non-living protagonist could be very interesting indeed, but is probably beyond my abilities. So, we'll say our protagonist is indeed alive.
</p><p>
<h1>Is our protagonist a human?</h1>
This question is rather difficult because answering it implicitly paints the world our protagonist lives in. 
If we say they are a human than we're implicitly saying they live in a world where humans exist, 
and we can presume they live in a human society, and so on. 
If we say they are not a human than we're implicitly saying they live in a world that has intelligent 
lifeforms complex enough to build a story around that <i>aren't</i> human. Aliens, anthropomorphisized animals 
or objects, we're implying the existance of <i>something</i> of that nature.
We want to keep the world open ended here, so let's just say our protagonist is an intelligent entity 
that at least roughly experiences the world as a human does. Now that we've specified that much, we can 
get to the first question we tried (and failed) to ask.
</p><p>
<h1>Is our character male or female?</h1>
Crucially the author identifies as a man so writing a female character would be difficult for them (me). 
But I also don't want to get stuck with considering stupid gender stuff and male roles in society and all that 
bullshit so let's say they're agender for now. Yes, I'm putting off these details until later, 
but perhaps a better way to write a character is to start with personality traits and other such high-level 
things and then work <i>backwards</i> to assign things like gender, race, species, circumstance and so on. 
So let's get right to the high-level stuff!
</p>
<h1>What is our character's personality traits?</h1>
<p>
 Wow what a fucking toughie this question is. Well, we can always decide someone else is the <i>real</i> 
 protagonist later if we feel like it, so no pressure. 
 This requires a bit of rumination. 
 In fact, the line "this requires a bit of rumination" was typed several hours after the preceding line, 
 thus proving the extent of rumination that this requires.
</p>
<p>
  Okay, let's just put off almost everything and start with <i>action</i>. We'll say our character is female,
  and they're like... in a room. Yeah, they're in their room. Good start. Thus begins our very first actual
  entry to the story:
</p>
<div class="story">A girl sits nondescriptly in her room.</div>
<p>How delightfuly ambiguous. Let's put a little bit of specificity in this.</p>
<div class="story">Her laptop sits upon her lap, hence the name.</div>
<p>Okay, this is boring. There would be no point in conveying a story through author's commentary unless
it could <i>only</i> be told through author's commentary. So let's make my commentary an essential part
of the story itself! The most sensible way to do this is to make our protagonist aware of my commentary,
  and then have her react appropriately. So let's do that.
</p>
<div class="story">She pauses to note the fact that the voice in her head that seems to know everything
is talking as though it has only just made its appearance, despite the fact that it has been present with her
for her entire life. This puzzles her immensely. 
</div>
<p>We want her ability to see the commentary to be like some kind of intrinsic superpower. Although it's not
much of a power, since she can't change anything the commentary says. If the commentary says "your mom is
gonna die in a car crash tomorrow," she can't do anything to prevent it. Unless of course I decide that
she can. So she is utterly powerless, despite the fact that her ability to read the narrative would seem
like a superpower to anybody else living in her world.</p>
<div class="story">She thinks about how redundant it is for her voice to be saying this when she's known it
since childhood. She thinks it very loudly to make sure her voice can hear, and hopefully explain.</div>
<p>Let's humor her. The "voice" is acting different because a story is about to begin. A tale of adventure,
emotion, and other nondescript things which may appear in any story that has not actually been thought up yet.</p>
<div class="story">She does not look all too pleased about this relevation. A story? That sounds like a lot
  of trouble. Stories are all about characters overcoming hardships to grow as people and shit like that,
  and that shit is difficult and inconvenient. Who would jump at the opportunity to experience hardship?
  To be given responsibility? To be forced to grow, even though they're perfectly happy in their current
  circumstances?</div>
  <p>Aha, see! This is how we will make the commentary essential to the plot. By introducing a conflict between
    our character and myself! Now we'll introduce characters and progress the plot in a way surely no one has
    ever thought of before.</p>
  <p>Oh my god, do you have any idea how difficult it is to create fake discord messages? Jesus christ. I
    might need to create a specialized tool for this shit. 
  </p>
  <p>You know what, fuck it. Let's use our imagination for now, shall we? That's what books are all about.
  Imagination. And I guess this is a book? Its medium is text, anyways.</p>
</div>
<div class="chat"><strike>Hey so</strike></div>
<p>Okay that so does not work at all. I guess I'm making that tool. Urgh.</p>
